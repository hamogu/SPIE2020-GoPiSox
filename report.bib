  abstract	= { High-resolution spectroscopy of astrophysical sources is
		  the key to gaining a quantitative understanding of the
		  history, dynamics, and current conditions of the cosmos. A
		  large-area (&gt; 1,000 cm2), high resolving power (R =
		  λ/Δλ&gt; 3000) soft x-ray grating spectrometer (XGS)
		  that covers the lines of C, N, O, Ne and Fe ions is the
		  ideal tool to address a number of high-priority science
		  questions from the 2010 Decadal Survey, such as the
		  connection between super-massive black holes and
		  large-scale structure via cosmic feedback, the evolution of
		  large- scale structure, the behavior of matter at high
		  densities, and the conditions close to black holes. While
		  no grating missions or instruments are currently approved,
		  an XGS aboard a potential future X-ray Surveyor could
		  easily surpass the above performance metrics. To improve
		  the chances for future soft x-ray grating spectroscopy
		  missions or instruments, grating technology has to progress
		  and advance to higher Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs).
		  To that end we have developed Critical-Angle Transmission
		  (CAT) gratings that combine the advantages of blazed
		  reflection gratings (high efficiency, use of higher
		  diffraction orders) with those of conventional transmission
		  gratings (low mass, relaxed alignment tolerances and
		  temperature requirements, high transparency at higher
		  energies). A CAT grating-based spectrometer can provide
		  performance 1-2 orders of magnitude better than current
		  grating instruments on Chandra and Newton-XMM with minimal
		  resource requirements. At present we have fabricated
		  large-area freestanding CAT gratings with narrow integrated
		  support structures from silicon-on- insulator wafers using
		  advanced lithography and a combination of deep reactive-ion
		  and wet etching. Our latest x-ray test results show record
		  high absolute diffraction efficiencies in blazed orders in
		  excess of 30% with room for improvement. },

  abstract	= {We report on measurements of the diffraction efficiency of
		  200-nm-period freestanding blazed transmission gratings for
		  wavelengths in the 0.96 to 19.4 nm range. These
		  critical-angle transmission (CAT) gratings achieve highly
		  efficient blazing over a broad band via total external
		  reflection off the sidewalls of smooth, tens of nanometer
		  thin ultrahigh aspect-ratio silicon grating bars and thus
		  combine the advantages of blazed x-ray reflection gratings
		  with those of more conventional x-ray transmission
		  gratings. Prototype gratings with maximum depths of 3.2 and
		  6 $\mu$m were investigated at two different blaze angles.
		  In these initial CAT gratings the grating bars are
		  monolithically connected to a cross support mesh that only
		  leaves less than half of the grating area unobstructed.
		  Because of our initial fabrication approach, the support
		  mesh bars feature a strongly trapezoidal cross section that
		  leads to varying CAT grating depths and partial absorption
		  of diffracted orders. While theory predicts broadband
		  absolute diffraction efficiencies as high as 60\% for ideal
		  CAT gratings without a support mesh, experimental results
		  show efficiencies in the range of $\sim$50--100\% of
		  theoretical predictions when taking the effects of the
		  support mesh into account. Future minimization of the
		  support mesh therefore promises broadband CAT grating
		  absolute diffraction efficiencies of 50\% or higher.}
